=================

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://zotplus.github.io/auto-index/zotero-auto-index-{% include auto-index-version.html %}.xpi)) (**{% include auto-index-version.html %}**)

Automatically keeps your attachments indexed. Preferences can be tweaked in the Zotero `Search` settings.

# Support - read carefully

My time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I
cannot accept bug reports
or support requests on anything but the latest version, currently at **{% include auto-index-version.html %}**. If you submit an issue report,
please include the version that you are on. By the time I get to your issue, the latest version might have bumped up
already, and you
will have to upgrade (you might have auto-upgraded already however) and re-verify that your issue still exists.
Apologies for the inconvenience, but such
are the breaks.
