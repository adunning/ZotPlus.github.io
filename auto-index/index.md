# Auto-index Zotero attachments

Automatically keeps your attachments indexed. Preferences can be tweaked in the Zotero `Search` settings.

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://zotplus.github.io/auto-index/zotero-auto-index-{% include auto-index-version.html %}.xpi)) (**{% include auto-index-version.html %}**)

If you experience any problems, or are unclear on how to use it, I'll be glad to [help](/support.html).
