ZotPlus offers a number of modules to extend the stock [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org) reference manager. The main focus
is currently in [Better BibTeX](better-bibtex/index.html), but more things are forthcoming. See the list of projects
above.

I release updates very frequently, and Firefox might not immediately pick up on them. The default check-to-update
interval is 24 hours; if you're impatient, go into `about:config` and set `extensions.update.interval` to any value you
deem prudent (in seconds). Setting it to `1` will have FF perform a check for updates every second, which will keep FF
*very* busy. Use with care.
