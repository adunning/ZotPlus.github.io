# ASCII rename for Zotero

Makes sure your attachments have no funny characters in them.

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://zotplus.github.io/ascii-rename/zotero-ascii-rename-{% include ascii-rename-version.html %}.xpi) (**{% include ascii-rename-version.html %}**). If you experience any problems, or are
unclear on how to use it, I'll be glad to [help](/support.html).

This plugin has no settings. If you install it, it will make sure attachment renames don't have non-ASCII characters. If
you want to disable this, you'll need to uninstall the plugin.
