# Collected Notes

Better BibTeX includes an exporter called "Collected notes". This exporter will export just notes -- standalone notes
and notes attached to references -- to LaTeX. It supports simple formatting to match the rich-text facilities of Zotero;
where it doesn't, file a bug. You can use this to (auto-)export all your reference notes and include it in your paper as
you're writing it. This way, Zotero can serve as a (very) simple research notebook.
