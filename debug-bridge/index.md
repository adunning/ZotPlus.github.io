# Zotero Debug Bridge

Add-on to allow for Selenium testing of Zotero, adds json-rpc infrastructure to allow driving the browser, as
execute_javascript cannot run chrome javascript. **Not intended for actual installation**, only for addition as part of
test runs. Actual installation into Firefox entails a security risk.
