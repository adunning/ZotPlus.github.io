# Link local files

When installed, this extension will silently link instead of import files as they are dropped om zotero (or otherwise
offered for import) when the are in the base directory (which needs to be set in the Zotero "advanced" preferences).
This behavior is Zotero-wide, and has no configuration; if you no longer want this behavior, remove or disable the
extension and restart Firefox/Zotero.

I created this plugin because I want my PDFs organized along with my own papers, and I do extensive markup  on my tablet,
which is gdrive-synced to my PCs; until Zotero offers a proper two-way tablet sync with conflict handling, this is my
preferred way of working.

**Caveats**: import is the default over linking for immensely good reasons:

* Linking instead of importing is fragile; a file rename will render the link broken, and while the PDF can neatly be organized along with your research, the PDF can
  typically reside in only one directory, which means that you can't easily use this mode of organisation for more than
  one research project.
* If you sync your library with others, they won't get the attachments
* If you sync your library with other PCs of your own, you will only get the attachments on the originating PC.

If you experience any problems, or are unclear on how to use it, I'll be glad to [help](/support.html).
